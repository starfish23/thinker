The story headline is \"A fractured fairy tale\". The story description is \"The Prince sits awkwardly on the couch, holding his glass slipper and trying to keep it from crushing. Lucinda and Theodora have the ends of the same couch, and they are taking turns seeing who can bend lowest and show off the most cleavage; while the old lady, in her wing chair, carries on about nonsense...\n\nGlass is a conversation-oriented fairy tale, taking place in one room. It was written to demonstrate one approach to handling conversation in Inform 7.\n\nFeatures a variety of additional verbs, non-player characters with an agenda, and narrative with multiple endings.\" The story creation year is 2006.\n\nRelease along with a solution, source text, a website, an interpreter, cover art, a file of \"Walkthrough\" called \"solution.txt\", a file of \"Making of...\" called \"Overview.html\".\n\nUse no scoring, the serial comma, and American dialect.\n\n\nChapter 1 - Mechanics of Speech\n\n[An overview:\n\nIn Glass, conversation consists, not of static things to say about specific topics, but of moves from one conversation topic to another.\n\nAny pair of ideas can have some specific dialogue associated with it, so that when we ask about marriage, we get a different answer if we are coming to the subject from the masquerade ball than if we are coming to it from the king's health (for instance). So we will define some conversation topics, called \"subjects\", and also provide tables of what may be said in moving from one subject to the next.\n\nThe player is allowed to try to move from any subject to any other, but non-player characters -- the other people in the room -- will only make conversational connections that \"make sense\": subjects that suggest related subjects. So we define a suggestion relation to connect one subject to others. \n\nNon-player characters are also trying to reach specific conversation outcomes, so they will seek the best path from the current subject to their goal subject, and keep the conversation moving in that direction. Only the player's intervention (or a change of goal) will knock this off course.]\n\nSection 1 - Subjects\n\nA subject is a kind of thing. The current subject is a thing that varies. Blank is a subject. The printed name of blank is \"whatever comes to mind\".\n\nSuggestion relates subjects to each other. The verb to suggest (it suggests, they suggest, it is suggested) implies the suggestion relation.\n\nSection 2 - Something to Talk About\n\n[Here we assemble all the subjects one might discuss:]\n\nThe king's health is a subject. Understand \"father's\" or \"father\" or \"king\" or \"ailing\" or \"sickness\" or \"doctor\" or \"kingdom\" or \"spanish doctor\" as the king's health. The king's health suggests heirs. Understand \"heir\" and \"succession\" and \"inheritance\" and \"prince\" as heirs. Heirs suggests the marriage. Marriage suggests the ball. Understand \"rumors\" and \"woman\" and \"lady\" and \"bride\" and \"wife\" and \"princess\" and \"face\" as marriage. The ball suggests the shoe. Understand \"terrace\" or \"chaperone\" or \"chaperones\" or \"impropriety\" or \"mask\" or \"masquerade\"  as the ball. \n\nUnderstand \"glass\" or \"slipper\" or \"glassy\" or \"glinting\" or \"pocket\" or \"boot\" or \"boots\" or \"laces\" or \"bootlaces\" or \"ankle\" or \"heel\" or \"toe\" or \"foot\" as the shoe. The shoe suggests Cinderella.  Understand \"cinders\" or \"cindy\" as Cinderella.\n\nTheo is a subject. Understand \"Theodora\" as Theo. Lucinda is a subject. Understand \"Lucy\" as lucinda.  Theo and Lucinda suggest heirs. Understand \"children\" or \"child\" or \"offspring\" or \"baby\" or \"babies\" or \"siblings\" or \"family\" as heirs. Stepmother is a subject. Understand \"lady\" or \"old lady\" or \"stepmother\" or \"mother\" or \"mom\" or \"harridan\" as the old lady. Stepmother suggests heirs.\n\nLove suggests marriage. Understand \"ladies\" or \"smoochies\" or \"seduction\" or \"romance\" or \"heart\" or \"hearts\" or \"cupid\" or \"kiss\" or \"romantic\" as love. Blood is a subject. Understand \"pain\" or \"cut\" or \"dripping\"  or \"drenched\" or \"sliced\" or \"slicing\" or \"knife\" as blood. Understand \"pillow\" as blood when Lucinda Endgame is happening.\n\nMagic is a subject. Understand \"enchantment\" or \"glamour\" or \"glamor\" or \"magical\" or \"crime\" or \"death\" or \"witch\" or \"witchcraft\" as magic. Magic suggests the ball. Understand \"departure\" or \"midnight\" as magic when Fitting is happening.\n\n God is a subject. God suggests the marriage. Understand \"church\" or \"christ\" or \"jesus\" or \"christian\" or \"religion\" or \"faith\" or \"theology\" or \"theological\" as god. Birds is a subject. Understand \"bird\" or \"parrot\" or \"me\" or \"polly\" or \"alex\" as the birds. \n\nRule for printing the name of birds while constructing the status line:\n\tsay \"you\"\n\nRule for printing the name of birds when mentioning birds:\n\tsay \"[nice word] bird\"\n\n[Here we establish where the conversation starts and where it is going during the first segment:]\n\nThe current subject is health. The last subject is a subject that varies. The last subject is health.\n\nThe target subject is a subject that varies. The target subject is shoe.\n\nSection 3 - Non-player Goal-seeking\n\n[And here we provide the non-player characters with the instructions for how to make conversational \"moves\".]\n\n[At different scenes of the game, we will be using different conversation sets, so we need to account for this as well:]\n\nConversation set is a table-name that varies. The conversation set is Table of Prologue Remarks.\n\nDefinition: a subject is fruitful if it produces conversation.\n\n[This rather bare-looking routine runs through the current conversation table and checks to see whether a given subject would be interested if someone selected it.]\n\nTo decide whether (next subject - a subject) produces conversation:\n\trepeat through conversation set\n\tbegin;\n\t\tif the starting entry is current subject or starting entry is blank \n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tif the final entry is next subject or final entry is blank, yes;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend repeat;\n\tno. \n\t\n[And here we look through the conversation set to see if we can find some appropriate conversation for the change of subject that just occurred, and (if so) print the dialogue.]\n\t\nTo relate (initial subject - a subject) with (next subject - a subject), directly or pausing first:\n\trepeat through conversation set\n\tbegin;\n\t\tif the starting entry is initial subject or starting entry is blank \n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tif the final entry is next subject or final entry is blank\n\t\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\t\tif pausing first, say \"There is a long thoughtful silence. \"; \n\t\t\t\tsay \"[comment entry][paragraph break]\";\n\t\t\t\tblank out the whole row;\n\t\t\t\trule succeeds;\n\t\t\tend if;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend repeat. \n\t\nA person can be active or passive. [* This is just a marker to keep track of whether the old lady (or any of the others) have already spoken during a turn; if so, we don't want them moving the dialogue on their own. One of my discoveries in previous conversation games is that it is usually best to limit non-player characters to one piece of dialogue behavior per turn -- either responding to something the player said OR advancing an idea of their own. If one allows them to do both, the conversation is controlled primarily by the game rather than the player, and many players find this frustrating.]\n\nEvery turn when the old lady is active: \n\tif Theodora Endgame is happening, rule succeeds;\n\tif Lucinda Endgame is happening, rule succeeds;\n\tlet pause be \"blank\";\n\tlet segue be the next step via the suggestion relation from the current subject to the target subject;\n\tif segue is a subject\n\tbegin;\n\t\twhile segue is not the target subject and segue is not fruitful\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tlet segue be the next step via the suggestion relation from the segue to the target subject;\n\t\t\tlet pause be \"There's a long, thoughtful sort of pause. \";\n\t\tend while;\n\t\tif pause is not \"blank\", \n\t\t\trelate the current subject with the segue, pausing first;\n\t\totherwise relate the current subject with the segue, directly;\n\t\tchange last subject to current subject;\n\t\tchange current subject to segue;\n\totherwise; \n\t\tchange the current subject to last subject;\n\t\tif Fitting has happened\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tmake no decision;\n\t\tend if;\n\t\tsay \"There's an uncomfortable silence as everyone tries to think of a sensible direction for the conversation to take from here.\n\t\t\n'Mm, we were speaking of [current subject],' says [a random visible person who is not the player].\";\n\tend if.\n\t\nEvery turn: now the old lady is active. [* This rule reactivates the old lady each turn, but after the spontaneous speaking rule above has already been tried.]\n\n\nChapter 2 - Grammar of Speech Commands\n\n[Now we provide the commands for the player to use to change the subject. This gets a little complicated because we have a lot of existing behavior to override. \n\nThe default behavior of the library allows the player to ASK any person ABOUT a subject; we don't want the player to be able to specify one person to talk to, since that would cause needless complexity. Anything he says should be heard by the whole group. We also are just allowing the player to speak keywords, so we don't want to distinguish between ASK and TELL, another feature of the standard library. \n\nSo we need to replace both ASK SOMEONE ABOUT SOMETHING and TELL SOMEONE ABOUT SOMETHING with one standard action that directs the player's speech to the whole group. We'll call this Mentioning.]\n\nSection 1 - Understanding\n\nUnderstand the command \"ask\" as something new. Understand the command \"tell\" as something new. Understand the command \"say\" as something new. Understand the command \"speak\" as something new. Understand the command \"shout\" as something new. Understand the command \"answer\" as something new. Understand the command \"scream\" as something new. \n\nUnderstand \"mention no\" as saying no. Understand \"mention yes\" as saying yes. Understand \"mention sorry\" or \"apologize\" as saying sorry. Understand \"refuse\" or \"disagree\" as saying no. Understand \"approve\" or \"agree\" as saying yes.\n\nUnderstand \"mention awk/awwk/awwwk/squawk\" as squawking.\n\nUnderstand \"ask about [any subject]\" as mentioning. Understand \"tell about [any subject]\" as mentioning. Understand \"a [any subject]\" as mentioning. Understand \"t [any subject]\" as mentioning. Understand \"answer [any subject]\" as mentioning.\n\n[Just for fun, let's make the game understand a wide range of parrot-appropriate squawkings, too:]\n\nUnderstand \"mention [any subject]\" as mentioning. Understand the commands \"caw\" and \"croak\" and \"squawk\" and \"awk\" and \"awwk\" and \"speak\" and \"say\" and \"talk\" and \"shout\" and \"scream\" and \"shriek\" and \"yell\" and \"screech\" as \"mention\". \n\n[Now having given the parrot this range of expression, let's make it so that we can print that exact text back later:]\nTo say exact verb:\n\t(- print (address) verb_word; -)\n\n[But of course, if the player uses t or a the results will come out a bit strange. Therefore:]\nAfter reading a command: if the player's command includes \"t \", replace the matched text with \"say \"; if the player's command includes \"a \", replace the matched text with \"say \"; if the player's command includes \"mention \", replace the matched text with \"say \"; if the player's command includes \"speak \", replace the matched text with \"say \".\n\nInstead of asking someone to try mentioning something: try mentioning the noun instead.  \n\n[Here we handle the error case wherein someone does try to speak to a specific individual:]  \n\nUnderstand \"ask [someone] about [text]\" as directed speech (with nouns reversed). Understand \"tell [someone] about [text]\" as directed speech (with nouns reversed). Understand \"answer [text] to [someone]\" as directed speech.\n\nInstead of answering someone that something: say \"You can only squawk things for everyone to hear.\"\n\t\n[And finally, to cover the case where the player types something like SQUAWK \"KING\":]\n\nInclude Punctuation Removal by Emily Short.\n\nAfter reading a command: \n\tremove stray punctuation; [* A phrase provided by the foregoing extension, which removes all quotation marks, exclamation points, and question marks from input before attempting to parse]\n\tif the player's command includes \"&\", replace the matched text with \"and\".\n\t \n\nSection 2 - Correcting Less-useful Input\n\nDirected speech is an action applying to one topic and one thing.\n\nCarry out directed speech: say \"You can only squawk things for everyone to hear.\"\n\nUnderstand \"squawk\" as squawking. Squawking is an action applying to nothing. Carry out squawking: do nothing. Report squawking: say \"'[awwk]!' you squawk.\"\n\n[And now a refinement. Suppose the player tries to mention something that isn't on our short list of topics? We don't want \"you can't see any such thing\" or even \"that noun makes no sense...\" as a result. So we make a catch-all response for this situation:]\n \nUnderstand \"mention [text]\" or \"ask about [text]\" or \"tell about [text]\" or \"a [text]\" or \"t [text]\" as jungle crying.\n\nJungle crying is an action applying to one topic.\n\nInstead of jungle crying a topic listed in the Table of Reactions: \n\tif there is a reaction rule entry\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay \"[response entry]\";\n\t\tabide by reaction rule entry;\n\totherwise;\n\t\tsay \"[response entry][paragraph break]\";\n\tend if.\n\t\t\nCarry out jungle crying:\n\tdo nothing.\n\nReport jungle crying:\n\tsay \"You stumble over that unfamiliar term and it just comes out a birdlike cry.\"\n\nTable of Awwkwardness\nresponse\n\"Awwk\"\n\"Awk\"\n\"Awwwk\"\n\"Squawk\"\n\"Squaw-awk\"\n\nTo say awwk:\n\tchoose a random row in the table of Awwkwardness;\n\tsay \"[response entry]\".\n\nAsking it about the subject is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing.\n\nCarry out asking it about the subject: \n\ttry mentioning the second noun.\n\nSection 3 - Handling Legitimate Remarks\n\n[And now at last we define the \"mentioning\" action.]\n\t\nMentioning is an action applying to one visible thing.\n\nCarry out mentioning:\n\tsay \"'[awwk]!' you [exact verb]. '[The noun][if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds]! [The noun][end if]!'\"; \n\t\n[The default behavior is to print the parrot's speech (in carry out, because this is one of those rare circumstances where the action involves generating some text -- just as examining prints the description in carry out). Then the non-player characters respond by trying to fit this outcry into the flow of their conversation. We make them silent at that point (\"now the old lady is passive\") so that their regular flow of every-turn conversation will be interrupted to deal with your intrusion.]\n\nReport mentioning:\n\tnow the old lady is passive;\n\trelate the current subject with the noun, directly;\n\t\tchange last subject to current subject;\n\tchange the current subject to the noun.\n\t\n[We can also override this behavior by giving constant responses to specific remarks:]\n\nInstead of mentioning blank: try squawking.\n\nInstead of mentioning God for the first time:\n\tsay \"'God!' you exclaim. All eyes turn slowly towards you.\n\t\n'Heavens,' says the Prince mildly. 'A pet with theological leanings. How unusual. You're most fortunate in your domesticated animals, madam.'\n\nThe old lady gives you a long, narrow-eyed look. Apparently she does not share the Prince's feelings on that topic.\"\t\n\nInstead of mentioning God for the third time:\n\tsay \"'God!' you [exact verb] again. 'Christ? Buddha? Zeus?'\n\t\n'Show-off,' Theodora mutters under her breath.\n\n'That will be enough from you,' says the old lady, looking at you with eyes almost as beady as your own.\"\n\t\nCarry out mentioning heirs when the current subject is king's health:\n\tsay \"'NEED BABIES,' you [exact verb]. 'Heirs to the kingdom, heirs to the kingdom!'\" instead.\n\nAfter mentioning the King's Health for the first time:\n\tsay \"The Prince glances your way and offers you a small, smiling salute.\"\n\nAfter mentioning heirs for the first time:\n\tsay \"Blood rushes up into the Prince's cheeks. He doesn't look your way.\"\n\n[And what happens if the player squawks something that the characters are already discussing?]\n\nReport mentioning the current subject:\n\trepeat through Table of Bad Bird Excuses\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay \"[response entry][paragraph break]\";\n\t\tblank out the whole row;\n\t\tnow the player is disgraced;\n\t\trule succeeds;\n\tend repeat.\n\n\t\nTable of Bad Bird Excuses\nresponse\n\"'Don't mind our parrot,' says the lady, smiling at the Prince. 'It has very bad manners.' \n\nThe Prince glances at you. 'I imagine any manners at all would be above average for a bird.'\n\nLucinda smirks.\"\n\"'It just repeats things it hears,' says Lucinda.\"\n\"'Ssh,' says Lucinda to you.\"\n\"'Honestly,' says Lucy. \n\n'It was raised by sailors,' the old lady says.\n\n'Pirates,' Theodora embellishes. She likes pirates.\n\nThe old lady kicks her ankle.\"\n\t\n\nSection 4 - Conversation Not Deserving Its Own Subject\n[Here we provide a small range of responses to things the player might say that do not deserve subjects of their own (they're not part of the conversation of the non-player characters and will not contribute to conversational flow) but which are still notable enough that the characters ought to have some reaction. These include outbursts of obscenity or other parrot catch-phrases that the player might try.]\n\t\nTable of Reactions\ntopic\tresponse\treaction rule\n\"[obscenity]\"\t\"\"\tobscenity reaction rule  \n\"[mild obscenity]\"\t\"\"\tmild reaction rule \n\"cracker/polly\" or \"polly wanna cracker\"\t\"'Polly wanna cracker!' you announce.

Everyone pretends you didn't speak.\"\n\"silence\"\t\"'Silence!' you squawk. \n\n'Not with you around,' snaps Lucinda.\"\n\"wisdom/thought/thinking\"\t\"'Wisdom,' you intone. \n\nNo one seems to think you know much about that.\"\t\n\"kindness\"\t\"'[awwk]! Kindness!' \n\nSadly this produces no almonds for you. \"\n\"corknut/corknuts/almond/almonds/cork nut\" or \"candied almond\"\t\"'Almond!' you hint.

'Inquire impertinently, be curious, ferret out, nose around!' \n\nThe old lady's mouth quirks at the corner, but she represses it.\n\n'Snoop! Listen in!' you add. But the Prince looks too daft to pick up your hint.\"\n\nThis is the obscenity reaction rule: try swearing obscenely instead. This is the mild reaction rule: try swearing mildly instead.\n\nSection 5 - Speech Acts\n[Yes, no, swearing, and saying sorry are accounted for in the basic library, and we should re-map these as well:]\n\nInstead of asking someone to try swearing mildly: try swearing mildly.\n\nInstead of swearing mildly:\n\tsay \"[A random visible woman] giggles faintly.\"\n\nUnderstand \"shit\" or \"fuck\" or \"damn\" or \"sod\" as \"[obscenity]\". [* We have more or less preserved Inform's default understanding of obscenity, though testers tried a range of other interesting words.]\n\nUnderstand \"swear\" or \"curse\" or \"mention obscenities\" as swearing obscenely.\n\nUnderstand \"bother\" or \"curses\" or \"drat\" or \"darn\" as \"[mild obscenity]\".\t\nInstead of swearing obscenely for the first time:\n\tnow the player is disgraced;\n\tsay \"You squawk very loudly.\n\t\n'If that happens again,' says the old woman to you, 'we will sell you to the first man with an earring we can find.'\n\nLucinda's cheeks go pink.\"\n\nSwearing obscenely is speech. Swearing mildly is speech. Saying yes is speech. Saying no is speech. Saying sorry is speech.\n\nInstead of asking someone to try doing something:\n\tif asking someone to try speech, continue the action;\n\tsay \"No one in this house obeys you at all.\"\n\nInstead of asking someone to try swearing obscenely: try swearing obscenely.\n\t\nInstead of swearing obscenely:\n\tsay \"'Right,' says the old lady. And she rings for a servant to remove you from the room.\";\n\tend the game saying \"You are sold to pirates and have a glorious career on the open sea\".\n\t\nA person can be disgraced or approved. A person is usually approved.\n\nBird trouble is a scene. Bird trouble begins when the player is disgraced. Bird trouble ends when time since bird trouble began is 2 minutes. When Bird trouble ends: now the player is approved.\n\nInstead of asking someone to try saying sorry: try saying sorry.\n\nInstead of answering someone that \"sorry\", try saying sorry.\n\nInstead of saying sorry:\n\tsay \"'Oops!' you squawk. 'Sorry! Oops, sorry!'\n\t\n[if player is disgraced]'Just mind your beak from now on, that's all,' says the old lady sternly. 'And stop interrupting.'\n\nEveryone turns back to the human conversation.[otherwise]They all ignore you.[end if]\"\n\nInstead of asking someone to try saying yes: try saying yes. Instead of answering someone that \"yes\", try saying yes.\n\nInstead of saying yes:\n\tsay \"'[awwk]! Yes!'\"\n\nInstead of asking someone to try saying yes: try saying no. Instead of answering someone that \"no\", try saying no.\n\nInstead of saying no:\n\tsay \"'No!' you squawk. 'No no!'\n\t\n[The random visible person who is not the player] frowns in your direction.\"\n\n[Now we've set up the conversation model; time to provide some actors.]\n\n\t \nChapter 3 - The World\n[Because most of what goes on here is conversation rather than interaction with objects, our setting is quite simple and most of it consists of the characters:]\n\nStage is a room.  \n\nThe old lady is a woman in the Stage. Understand \"mother\" or \"stepmother\" as the old lady.  The old lady is active. The description of the lady is \"She looks plucked: thin neck with folds of skin exposed, nose beaky, lips white. Perhaps when her fortunes are mended her cosmetics too will improve.\"\n\nThe Prince is a man in the Stage. The description of the prince is \"He's tolerably attractive, in his flightless way. It's hard not to pity him a little.\" The prince carries a glass slipper. The glass slipper is wearable. Understand \"shoe\" or \"heel\" or \"toe\" or \"foot\" as the slipper. The description of the slipper is \"It is very small for an adult woman's foot.\" \n\nLucy and Theodora are women in the Stage. The printed name of Lucy is \"Lucinda\". Understand \"Lucinda\" as Lucy. Understand \"Theo\" as Theodora.[* The complication here is that we have both a person object and a subject object for each of these, and we want to avoid overlapping names.]  The description of Theodora is \"Soft, round, in every sense yielding: she eats too many candied almonds herself, but never grudges sharing them. No character worth mentioning.\" The description of Lucy is \"More compact than Theodora, and with more self-control.\" \n\nThe sofa is scenery in the stage. It is an enterable supporter. The description is \"They never let you stand on it.\" Some pillows are on the sofa. Understand \"pillow\" as the pillows. The description of the pillows is \"Not as pretty as you.\" The pillows are scenery.\n\nThe wing chair is scenery in the stage. It is an enterable supporter. The description is \"Pitiful wings, really.\" Understand \"wingchair\" or \"seat\" as the chair.\n\nInstead of doing anything other than examining when the noun is a thing and the noun is scenery: say \"That would not help matters, even if you could reach.\"\n\nThe perch is in the stage. It is scenery.

Part of the plan is to control the flow of conversation with a series of scenes; in each scene, different conversation is possible and the characters have different conversational goals.\n\nWhat follows is a set of scenes, each with its own conversation set.]\n\nSection 1 - Scene Aesthetics\n[This is just a decorative nicety: we're removing the room-name and score and turn count from the status bar, so we should replace it with some other hint of the game state. What might be useful? Well, perhaps something that tells us what the conversation is currently about, and also gives some indication of the tone in the room. So:]\n\nCurrent action is some text that varies. The current action is \"Idly\".\n\nWhen play begins:\n\tchange the left hand status line to \"[current action] discussing [the current subject]\";\n\tchange the right hand status line to \" \";\n\nSection 2 - Prologue\n[...In which we lead up to the subject of the Prince's having fallen in love.\n\nAs promised, each conversation set contains responses for moves the player (or NPCs) might make: from one subject to another. Each response is removed from the table after use, to prevent any repetition; if we want that move to provide interesting dialogue even if it is repeated exactly, we provide several entries for it (see the king's health to heirs move, below, which has two responses). The first one will be used the first time that move occurs; the second the second time; and so on.\n\n\"blank\" is a stand-in subject, a kind of wild-card that will match anything. We will use this on occasions where we do not want to specify both the \"from\" and \"to\" parts of the move.]\n\nTable of Prologue Remarks\nstarting\tfinal\tcomment\nking's health\theirs\t\"'It's so fortunate,' says the old lady.

'But he has always been very brave, and philosophical. I believe he would meet death with a Socratic--' \n\nSeeing that he has left behind his entire audience, including the old lady, he changes tack. '--with true Christian fortitude.'\n\nThere is a collective sigh of relief at a pious thought so comprehensibly expressed.\"\nblank\tking's health\t\"'I know very well how hard it will be to emulate my father's command,' says the Prince. 'He has a knowledge of how to speak to people which I do not.' \n\n'Pssht,' says the old lady. You notice she does not actually contradict him.\" \nblank\tking's health\t\"'May he live long,' says Lucinda softly.\"\nblank\tking's health\t\"'You must try not to worry too desperately,' Lucinda says to the Prince in a comforting tone.

'But doctors are human, and fallible.'\"\nheirs\tking's health\t\"'It would have been better for us all if I had siblings,' says the Prince. 'My father feels it, I know.'\"\nheirs\tmarriage\t\"'Now I have heard a rumor,' says the old lady, pretending that this conversation topic just now occurred to her, rather than being the object of her determined pursuit for the last half hour. 'A rumor that you yourself were planning to wed, in the very near future.' \n\nTheodora leans closer to the Prince, who tucks his hands more protectively around the slipper. \n\n'There are a great many rumors,' he says.\"\nheirs\tmarriage\t\"'I think I am not expressing a unique opinion,' says the old lady, brushing at her skirt with her gloves, 'when I say that the whole kingdom will be delighted to see your family increase yet further.'\"\nmarriage\tball\t\"'It's true, you know, that my father threw the ball in the hope that I would-- that is, that it would lead to a greater acquaintance--' The Prince stops again, rattled, and glares down at the small shoe cradled in his hands. 'I had not been very attentive to ladies in my youth.' \n\nThe old lady looks very strange at that remark. 'Well-- my dear boy--' she begins. 'I am glad you feel comfortable-- that is, I will not mention-- if you feel you prefer--'\n\nHe blinks thick girlish lashes, and you see why she is worried. 'No, I didn't mean that I have a preference for boys, madam,' he remarks, more at his ease now that she is uncomfortable. 'Only that I have been very much occupied with other concerns, and not...'\n\nHe gestures. The shoe almost slips off its pillow. He catches it just in time.\"\nblank\tlove\t\"A look of unexpected sweetness crosses the face of the Prince. The old lady watches this with interest.\"\nblank\tshoe\t\"[if not mentioning shoe]'I'm sure it's nothing surprising,' remarks the old lady, 'if you didn't meet anyone at the ball that you felt immediately you could marry. Such short acquaintances... there's much more to an alliance than that. One must feel at ease with the family, for instance.' \n\nThe Prince opens his mouth, then closes it again. 'I did meet someone,' he admits. 'But I know nothing of her family. It hardly matters to me, however. [otherwise]The Prince gives you an odd, almost grateful look. 'In fact I have chosen a wife,' he says. 'At the ball my father gave. [end if]It will be the woman who can wear this shoe.' \"\nblank\tball\t\"The Prince sighs. 'Yes,' he says. 'The ball, I meant to tell you...' \n\nHe stops.\"\nmarriage\tTheo\t\"Theodora blushes with sudden consciousness. The Prince glances at her piercingly. \n\n'Out of the mouths of birds,' remarks the old lady, smiling.\"\nmarriage\tbirds\t\"'Do you suppose it means that marriage is for the birds?' asks Lucinda. \n\n'It has a certain Delphic inscrutability,' says the Prince, grinning at her.\"\nblank\tbirds\t\"'I suppose it wishes to advocate a greater interest in aviary concerns?' the Prince asks, looking at you with curiosity. \n\n'I wouldn't credit it with nearly that much intelligence,' says the old lady.

'That was when I was younger,' she says.\n\nThe Prince raises his eyebrows. 'Surely a serious vocation could manifest itself even in a child?' he says. 'I would not be too quick to reject the possibility, if--' \n\nLucinda is leaning forward at him again. \n\n'--if you think it is what you were meant for,' he finishes weakly. 'Then again, it might have been a childish whim.'\"\nblank\theirs\t\"'How sad that your dear mother did not live along enough to give you siblings,' says the old lady, dabbing the edge of her eye with one finger. \n\n'You probably don't remember your mother -- such a sweet woman -- a wonderful friend to me at that time.' She sighs. 'I know I talk so much nonsense to you, Prince, but it is for her sake. I cannot help thinking that she would have wanted me to take a little concern for you.'\"\nlove\tmarriage\t\"'It is a pity,' says the old lady. 'But love and marriage often have so little to do with one another, at the upper levels of society. And certainly when matters of state intervene.' \n\n'So my father reminds me,' says the Prince. 'He considers me a romantic and says I have been reading too much Byron.'\n\n'And have you?' asks the old lady curiously.\n\n'I cannot abide Byron and am devoted to Sir Philip Sidney, and the difference between my father and me is that I have paid enough attention to have a taste in these matters.' He smiles briefly. 'So you see he loses the battle and wins the war.'\"\nblank\tlove\t\"'I think the feelings at the outset of a marriage are nearly irrelevant,' says Lucinda. 'If there is commitment and good intention, then you can learn to live with the person, and if there isn't... no amount of affection, or, or...' \n\n'Physical attraction, is what my sister means to say,' Theodora cuts in.\n\n'Or that, yes-- none of those things will count.'\n\nTheodora makes a face.

'I wrote down some notes at the end of the evening. Everything I could remember about her, everything I recalled her saying to me. I believe I noted that she was pretty.'\n\nThe old lady casts about for something to say to that.\"\nblank\tlove\t\"'Do you--' begins the old lady. 'Oh, dear, this is such a delicate question, and there is no tactful way to put it. Do you have reason to think she reciprocates your regard?' \n\n'Mama, he's the Prince!' exclaims Theo, looking scandalized.\n\n'I know, dear,' says the old lady. 'But it is possible that she does not feel the same way he does, and one-sided love-matches are worse, I think, than marriages of pure convenience on both sides.'\n\nThe Prince's cheeks go a little pink. 'She told me-- that is, she put it very delicately, but she gave the impression that she had admired me for some time.'\n\n'Ah,' says the old lady.\"\nlove\tmarriage\t\"'If she does love you,' Lucinda says, 'I wonder why she was not more straightforward?

Your father did not stint on the candles at all.' \n\nThe Prince opens his mouth.\n\n'Oh, dear, dear, I am being odiously prying. I'm so sorry. Perhaps you met this young lady out on the terrace...' She trails off, suggesting the very faintest disapproval of young ladies who linger on terraces, out of sight of chaperones, to hold conversations with Princes, and never tell their names.\n\n'I met her in candlelight,' says the Prince, goaded. 'But she left me at midnight.'\n\nThe effect of this comment is like the shattering of glass: for a moment you wonder if he dropped the shoe...? No. It is merely that he has admitted, or near-as-admitted, that his chosen bride is one who appeared to him under a glamor, a magical enchantment. A crime punishable by death under his father's law.\n\nEveryone remains very very quiet.\" \n\n\nWondering ends when the current subject is the ball. \n\nSection 4 - Fitting\n[In which we work towards the idea that someone here should try the shoe (and for lack of a better idea, we will assume that person is Theo.)]\n\nFitting is a scene.

'Magic is abhorrent to God,' she says.\n\n'That is certainly the opinion of some,' the old lady agrees. 'I myself wonder whether He would have encompassed in His creation any power which He considered wholly evil. But that is a private philosophy, and does not excuse a violation of the law.'

The Prince looks back and forth, confused.\"\nblank\tmarriage\t\"'It seems to me,' says the old lady, after a long thoughtful moment, 'that you have no choice but to try this shoe on every eligible young woman, and determine who she was.
